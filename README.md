## Ralph Ferrara
Couchsurfer Application Test

##Developer Notes, explainations and general excuses
1. Due to time contraints obviously there are lot of room for improvments, security/sanitization and testing. 
2. Setup probably took up most of the development time
3. Copilot and ChatGPT were used, but only in the interest of saving time on repetitive/tasks, test data creation, general setup since and prettying up the JSX using tailwind
4. Total time was between 2-3 hours for basic setup and basic functionality. Optimizing, and general tweaking will continue until I get bored or my children bug me. 
5. Most of the database and some code was copy/pasted from pre-existing code, but I figured since the goal was to see my coding style, re-using my own code was fair game. 
6. MySQL was used instead of a JSON or simpler setup since one of the optional specs was requesting friends, which just begs for a relational database.
7. Could have been more dialed in React components (for example User)
